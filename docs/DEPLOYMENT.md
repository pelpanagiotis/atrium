# Deployment

Atrium runs as two processes against PostgreSQL 16. The Compose file is meant for Coolify with Traefik already on the host network. Do not point Coolify at a `convex deploy` workflow. This application does not use Convex.

## Services

- `postgres` creates `atrium_migrator` (superuser, migrations only), `atrium_app` (no bypass RLS), and `atrium_worker` (bypass RLS).
- `migrate` applies `db/migrations` once and exits.
- `app` serves Next.js on port 38471 and exposes `/api/health`.
- `worker` drains jobs and the outbox. Leave `EMBEDDED_WORKER` unset in production so the web process does not also hold the worker connection.

Traefik labels route `Host(\`${ATRIUM_HOST}\`)` to port 38471 with TLS. Set `BETTER_AUTH_URL` to the public https origin. Coolify should terminate TLS at Traefik and forward the original host.

## Environment

Set these once when the stack is created. Compose reads them and builds every database URL from the role passwords, so you never set `DATABASE_URL*` yourself.

Generate the secrets with `openssl rand -base64 32`.

### Required

| Variable | Used by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | postgres | Superuser password. |
| `APP_PASSWORD` | postgres, app, worker | Password for `atrium_app`, the RLS-bound role. |
| `WORKER_PASSWORD` | postgres, worker | Password for `atrium_worker`. |
| `MIGRATE_PASSWORD` | postgres, migrate | Password for `atrium_migrator`. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | app | Signs sessions. Changing it signs everyone out. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | app | Public origin, for example `https://atrium.example.com`. Provider callbacks and MCP URLs derive from it. |
| `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | app, worker | Encrypts stored provider tokens. Back it up. Losing it makes saved tokens unreadable. |
| `ATRIUM_HOST` | app (Traefik label) | Public hostname without a scheme, for example `atrium.example.com`. |

The role passwords must not contain single quotes. `docker/postgres/init.sh` runs only on the first database boot, so changing a role password later means updating the role with `ALTER ROLE` as well as the environment variable.

### Optional

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LINEAR_CLIENT_ID`, `LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET` | blank | Enables OAuth for Linear. |
| `JIRA_CLIENT_ID`, `JIRA_CLIENT_SECRET` | blank | Enables OAuth for Jira. |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | blank | Enables OAuth for GitHub. |
| `GITLAB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET` | blank | Enables OAuth for GitLab. |
| `GITEA_CLIENT_ID`, `GITEA_CLIENT_SECRET` | blank | Enables OAuth for Gitea. |
| `GITEA_SITE_URL` | `https://gitea.com` | Set for a self-hosted Gitea. |
| `ALLOW_FAKE_PROVIDER` | `false` | Keep `false` in production. |

There are two ways to set the OAuth client ID and secret:

- **Deployment:** set the `*_CLIENT_ID` and `*_CLIENT_SECRET` variables in the container environment, and restart the app.
- **Workspace settings:** an owner or admin adds them on the Integrations page, under OAuth apps. The secret is encrypted with `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and never shown again.

Values saved in a workspace take priority. The deployment variables are the fallback, so an existing setup keeps working. Without either, an admin can paste a provider access token instead. That token is encrypted before it is stored. Register apps and callback URLs as described in [OAUTH.md](./OAUTH.md), using `pnpm oauth:redirects` to print them. Minimum scopes when OAuth is configured:

- Linear: `read`, `write`
- Jira: `read:jira-work`, `write:jira-work`, `offline_access`
- GitHub: classic `repo` (issues on private repositories)
- GitLab: `api`, `read_user`

### Set by Compose, do not set

- `EMBEDDED_WORKER` is forced to `false` for the app, so the worker runs only in its own container.
- `NODE_ENV` is `production`.
- `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_URL_WORKER`, and `DATABASE_URL_MIGRATE` are built from the role passwords.

### Not needed for a container deployment

- `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_ROOT` only matters when the container can read a LiveSync mirror from its own filesystem. The remote vault bridge needs nothing from the container.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` from `.env.example` is not read by the code.

### Never run in production

`pnpm db:seed` creates demo accounts with a known password. Do not run it against a deployed database.

## Local commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
pnpm dev
pnpm worker
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm test:e2e
```

`pnpm dev` listens on `127.0.0.1:38471`. With `EMBEDDED_WORKER=true` in `.env.local`, the Next.js process also drains the queue so a second terminal is optional.

## Production build

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

The Dockerfile has three stages. `build` installs everything and runs `next build`. `deps` installs production dependencies only. `runtime` copies the Next.js standalone server, `src`, `scripts`, and `db`, and runs as the non-root `node` user.

The web container starts with `node standalone/server.js`. The `migrate` and `worker` services override the command with `pnpm db:migrate` and `pnpm worker`.

Compose starts `migrate` before `app`, and `worker` after `app` is healthy. Postgres is not published on a host port.

### Before the first deploy

1. Create the stack with the required variables above.
2. Confirm `https://<ATRIUM_HOST>/api/health` returns `{"ok":true}`.
3. Sign up the first account in the browser. Do not seed.
