# Security checklist

- [ ] `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` are unique, 32-byte base64 values, and are not stored in the database backup.
- [ ] `atrium_app` is not a superuser and does not have `BYPASSRLS`.
- [ ] `atrium_migrator` is used only for migrations.
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL_WORKER` is present on the worker, not in browser code.
- [ ] `ALLOW_FAKE_PROVIDER` is false outside tests and local demos.
- [ ] `BETTER_AUTH_URL` is the public https origin. Secure cookies turn on when `NODE_ENV=production`.
- [ ] Traefik or another proxy sets a request body limit. The webhook route also rejects bodies over 1 MB.
- [ ] Webhook routes require a valid HMAC over the raw body. Invalid signatures return 401 after the delivery is stored as rejected.
- [ ] Auth and webhook endpoints are rate limited in Postgres.
- [ ] Provider tokens are encrypted. Disconnect sets `credential_ciphertext` to null. List responses expose `hasCredential`, not the secret.
- [ ] Logs pass through `redact` for keys that look like tokens, secrets, passwords, or cookies.
- [ ] Outbound provider calls allow only https on port 443. Known SaaS hosts (Linear, Atlassian, GitHub, GitLab, Gitea) are allowlisted; self-hosted Gitea/GitLab hostnames are allowed only when DNS resolves to a public address.
- [ ] OAuth scopes stay at the minimum listed in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`. Revoke a connection from Integrations; that clears the stored credential.
- [ ] Invitations store only a SHA-256 of the token. The raw link is shown once to the inviter. There is no mail transport.
- [ ] Every private page and server action reads the session. Workspace role checks run in the service, not only in the interface.
- [ ] Sign-in “Keep me signed in” uses Better Auth `rememberMe`. Unchecked sessions are browser-session cookies only; checked sessions last up to 14 days. `session.cookieCache` stores a short-lived signed `session_data` cookie (5 minutes) so routine `getSession` calls can skip the database — revoke still wins after that cache expires.
- [ ] Review audit events for role changes, invitations, integration connect and disconnect, and task mutations.

Known boundary: anyone who can connect as `atrium_app` can set `app.current_user_id`. Treat that connection string as an application secret.
